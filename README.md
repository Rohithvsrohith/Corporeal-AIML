## ✨ Features

- **corporeal-baselinecnn.ipynb**:  
  Hands-on notebook for training a baseline CNN model.
- **corporeal-resnet50.ipynb**:  
  Notebook leveraging the power of ResNet50 for transfer learning and improved performance.
- Clean, well-commented code for easy understanding and modification.
- Modular design for extensibility to other architectures and datasets.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Corporeal-AIML.git
   cd Corporeal-AIML
   ```

2. **Set up a Python 3.11+ environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   _If `requirements.txt` is not present, manually install:_  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
   # or for PyTorch
   # pip install torch torchvision
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open either `corporeal-baselinecnn.ipynb` or `corporeal-resnet50.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to:
    - Prepare your dataset.
    - Train and evaluate the models.
    - Visualize results and adjust model parameters as needed.

_Notebooks are self-contained and ready for experimentation!_
